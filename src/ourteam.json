The committee referred to as Gen Board is comprised of first year and second year students who shadow other committees in the winter and spring quarters to better integrate themselves into the Mayfest community and get exposure to the responsibilities they would have as a committee member. Typically, Gen Board members have returned the following year as a committee member of one of the groups they shadowed. Ultimately, membership on this committee serves as a great way to bolster one’s knowledge about the organization and its many functions.",
